# Hand_Gesture_Recognition
This calls knnclassify on MATLAB and organizes data from Virtual Motion Labs' Data Glove Lite.

The goal of this project is to test the robustness of k-nearest-neighbor algorithm and discover how 
training basis, quantity of samples, and relationship of finger flexibility and hand rotation affect
the accuracy of gesture recoginition.

There are five static gestures and over 15 volunteers for this project.
